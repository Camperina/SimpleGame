# SimpleGame
Assignment for Human Computer Interaction Class (ITE 450)

The final project for this class was to create a simple game with two options: a high roll vs low roll game and Sudoku. 
The project was broken into five phases. 

In phase 1, we had to come up with a PACT (People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies) Analysis. 
We also had to come up with different personas and scenarios to help us think about the different types of people who would potentially
play these games and how/where they would be playing them. In this phase we also had to hand-draw our idea of what the menu
for each game would look like.

Phase 2 was an HTA (Hierarchical Task Analysis) and listing out the planned steps. I had to determine how the game would be played, 
what options the user would have, and what would happen for each of those options. There was a flow chart diagram that went along with the HTA.

Phase 3 took the planned steps from phase 2 and turn them into an actual game. This part of the project documents the steps and shows
a screenshot of what the player sees. The report for phase 3 is almost like a user manual.

In phase 4 we focused on a post-game survey. I had to come up with a list of questions to ask players after they played my game. I had
determine what I wanted to accomplish with the questionnaire and explain why I was asked each question. I also included actual surveys,
doucmented participant responses, and made comments regarding verbal questions I may have asked them.

Phase 5 finalized the results from phase 4 into a summary. This phase included graphs and charts. It also includes my reflections about
things I would change or modify, if time permitted, based on participant feedback.
